Project rules offer a powerful and flexible system with path specific configurations. Project rules are stored in the .cursor/rules directory and provide granular control over AI behavior in different parts of your project.

Hereâ€™s how they work

Semantic Descriptions: Each rule can include a description of when it should be applied
File Pattern Matching: Use glob patterns to specify which files/folders the rule applies to
Automatic Attachment: Rules can be automatically included when matching files are referenced
Reference files: Use @file in your project rules to include them as context when the rule is applied.
