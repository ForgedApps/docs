{{< callout emoji="🔍" >}}
The search functionality uses fuzzy matching, so you don't need to type the exact name of a technology to find it.
{{< /callout >}}

### Using the Search Page

To search for a technology:

1. Click on the search link in the top navigation bar
2. Type your search query in the search page
3. Results will appear as you type, showing matching technologies
4. Click on a result to navigate to that item's details

### Search Tips

For more effective searching:

- **Use keywords** from the technology name or description
- **Try partial matches** if you're unsure of the exact spelling
- **Use lowercase** as the search is case-insensitive
- **Press Escape** to clear the search and return to the full radar view

## Filtering by Tag

Tags provide a way to categorize technologies and filter the radar view.
