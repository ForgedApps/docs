The Technology Radar is a visualization tool that helps organizations track and communicate their technology landscape. This page explains the key components of the radar and how to interpret them.

## Radar Structure

The radar is structured as a circular visualization divided into four quadrants, with concentric rings representing different adoption stages.

<Callout>
The radar visualization provides an at-a-glance view of your organization's technology portfolio, showing what technologies are being used, evaluated, or phased out.
</Callout>

### Quadrants

Quadrants represent different technology categories. By default, the radar includes four quadrants:

1. **Languages & Frameworks** - Programming languages and frameworks
2. **Tools** - Development and operational tools
3. **Platforms & Operations** - Infrastructure, platforms, and operational technologies
4. **Methods & Patterns** - Development methodologies, architectural patterns, and processes

<Callout type="info">
Quadrants can be customized by administrators to match your organization's specific categorization needs.
</Callout>

### Rings

Rings represent different stages of technology adoption, from innermost to outermost:

1. **Adopt** - Technologies that are proven and recommended for use
2. **Trial** - Technologies that are promising and should be explored in projects
3. **Assess** - Technologies that are worth exploring to understand how they might affect your organization
4. **Hold** - Technologies that should be avoided for new projects

<Callout type="warn">
The meaning of rings may vary depending on how your organization has configured the radar. Check the ring descriptions for specific guidance.
</Callout>

### Blips

Each technology on the radar is represented by a "blip" - a small circle or triangle positioned in the appropriate quadrant and ring. The shape and color of blips can indicate additional information:

- **Circle** - Unchanged status since the last radar update
- **Triangle** - New or moved since the last radar update
- **Colors** - May represent different categories or statuses (depends on configuration)

## Reading the Radar

When interpreting the radar:

1. **Position matters** - Items closer to the center are more recommended for use
2. **Movement matters** - Items that have moved inward are gaining adoption, while those moving outward are declining
3. **Clustering matters** - Areas with many blips indicate technology focus areas

The radar is a snapshot in time. Regular updates show how technologies are evolving within your organization.
