# Interpreting Technology Items

This page explains how to understand and interpret the technology items displayed on the Tech Radar for Compass.

## Item Representation

Technologies on the radar are represented as "blips" - small shapes positioned in the appropriate quadrant and ring.

The position, shape, and color of a blip provide important information about a technology's status and classification.

### Blip Shapes

The shape of a blip indicates its status:

- **Circle** - Unchanged status since the last radar update
- **Triangle** - New or moved since the last radar update (has the "new" or "changed" flag)

### Blip Colors

The color of a blip typically corresponds to its quadrant:

- Each quadrant has its own color (configurable by administrators)
- This makes it easier to visually associate blips with their quadrants

### Blip Position

The position of a blip indicates:

- **Quadrant** - The category the technology belongs to
- **Ring** - The adoption stage of the technology
- **Clustering** - Similar or related technologies may be positioned near each other

## Item Details

When you click on a blip or item in the list, you'll see detailed information about the technology.

### Basic Information

The basic information includes:

- **Name** - The name of the technology
- **Quadrant** - The category it belongs to
- **Ring** - Its current adoption stage
- **Status** - Whether it's new, changed, or unchanged

### Description

The description provides:

- An explanation of what the technology is
- Its key features and benefits
- Use cases and applications
- Potential limitations or considerations

### History

The history section shows:

- How the technology has moved between rings over time
- When changes occurred
- Previous descriptions or assessments

This historical context helps you understand the evolution of the technology within your organization.

### Tags

Tags provide additional categorization:

- Technologies may have multiple tags
- Tags can represent use cases, platforms, languages, etc.
- Tags are clickable to filter the radar by that tag

## Status Flags

Status flags indicate the state of items on the radar:

{{< tabs items="New,Changed,Default" >}}
{{< tab >}}
### New Flag

The "new" flag indicates:

- The technology has been added to the radar in the current version
- It's appearing for the first time
- It's worth paying attention to as a new addition

New items are typically represented by triangles on the radar.

### Changed Flag

The "changed" flag indicates:

- The technology has moved to a different ring since the last version
- Its assessment or recommendation has changed
- There may be new information or experiences with the technology

Changed items are typically represented by triangles on the radar.

### Default Flag

The "default" or unchanged flag indicates:

- The technology's position and assessment remain the same as in the previous version
- No significant changes have occurred in its status

Default items are typically represented by circles on the radar.

## Ring Interpretation

Understanding what each ring means is crucial for interpreting the radar:

### Adopt Ring

Technologies in the Adopt ring:

- Are proven and mature
- Have been successfully used in production
- Are recommended for use in new projects
- Have organizational support and expertise

### Trial Ring

Technologies in the Trial ring:

- Show promise and potential value
- Have been tested in limited contexts
- Are worth exploring in projects
- May have some limitations or unknowns

### Assess Ring

Technologies in the Assess ring:

- Are worth exploring to understand their impact
- Are not yet ready for production use
- Require investigation and evaluation
- May be emerging or evolving rapidly

### Hold Ring

Technologies in the Hold ring:

- Should be avoided for new projects
- May be legacy technologies being phased out
- Could have security, performance, or support issues
- Might be replaced by better alternatives

The exact meaning of rings may vary depending on your organization's configuration. Always check the ring descriptions provided in your radar.

## Making Decisions

When using the radar to inform technology decisions:

1. **Consider the quadrant** - Is this the right type of technology for your needs?
2. **Check the ring** - Is this technology recommended for use?
3. **Read the description** - Understand the context and considerations
4. **Review the history** - See how the assessment has changed over time
5. **Look at related technologies** - Are there alternatives in more favorable rings?

The radar is a guide, not a mandate. Use it alongside other factors like team expertise, project requirements, and business context when making technology decisions.
