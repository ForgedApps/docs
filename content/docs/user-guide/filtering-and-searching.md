This page explains how to filter and search for specific technologies in the Tech Radar for Compass.

## Search Functionality

The search feature allows you to quickly find specific technologies by name or keyword.

{{< callout emoji="🔍" >}}
The search functionality uses fuzzy matching, so you don't need to type the exact name of a technology to find it.
{{< /callout >}}

### Using the Search Box

To search for a technology:

1. Click on the search box in the top navigation bar (or press the `/` key)
2. Type your search query
3. Results will appear as you type, showing matching technologies
4. Click on a result to navigate to that item's details

### Search Tips

For more effective searching:

- **Use keywords** from the technology name or description
- **Try partial matches** if you're unsure of the exact spelling
- **Use lowercase** as the search is case-insensitive
- **Press Escape** to clear the search and return to the full radar view

## Filtering by Tag

Tags provide a way to categorize technologies and filter the radar view.

### Using Tag Filters

To filter the radar by tag:

1. Look for the tag filter section below the radar visualization
2. Click on a tag to filter the radar to show only items with that tag
3. The active tag will be highlighted to indicate it's being applied
4. Click the tag again to remove the filter

### Multiple Tags

Depending on the configuration, you may be able to filter by multiple tags:

1. Click on the first tag you want to filter by
2. Click on additional tags to further refine the filter
3. Click on an active tag to remove it from the filter

## Filtering by Quadrant

You can focus on a specific quadrant to see only the technologies in that category.

### Quadrant Filtering

To filter by quadrant:

1. Click on a quadrant label on the radar visualization
2. The radar will update to show only that quadrant
3. Click the "Zoom In" button on a quadrant to focus on it
4. Click "Zoom Out" to return to the full radar view

## Filtering by Ring

You can filter technologies by their adoption stage (ring).

### Ring Filtering

To filter by ring:

1. In the quadrant list view, click on a ring name
2. The list will scroll to show technologies in that ring
3. Some configurations may allow clicking on a ring in the visualization to filter

## Combined Filtering

For more precise results, you can combine different filtering methods:

1. First, filter by quadrant to focus on a specific technology category
2. Then, apply a tag filter to further refine the results
3. Finally, use the search box to find specific technologies within the filtered view

{{< callout type="info" >}}
The current filters are typically displayed somewhere in the interface, allowing you to see what filters are active and remove them if needed.
{{< /callout >}}

## Clearing Filters

To clear all filters and return to the full radar view:

- Click on active filters to remove them individually
- Click a "Clear Filters" or "Reset" button if available
- Refresh the page to reset all filters

## Saving and Sharing Filtered Views

Some radar configurations may allow you to save or share a filtered view:

1. Apply the desired filters
2. Look for a "Share" or "Copy Link" button
3. Use the generated URL to share the filtered view with others

This is particularly useful for focusing discussions on specific technology areas or sharing relevant technologies with team members.
