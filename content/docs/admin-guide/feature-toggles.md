Feature toggles control various aspects of the radar's functionality and appearance. By enabling or disabling specific features, you can create a streamlined experience that focuses on the aspects most important to your users.

## Available Feature Toggles

The Tech Radar for Compass includes several feature toggles that control different aspects of the user interface:

### Show Chart

Controls whether the radar chart visualization is displayed on the main page.

- **Enabled**: The radar chart is displayed, providing a visual representation of technologies
- **Disabled**: The radar chart is hidden, showing only the list view

{{< callout type="info" >}}
Disabling the chart can be useful for organizations that prefer a list-based view or want to reduce visual complexity.
