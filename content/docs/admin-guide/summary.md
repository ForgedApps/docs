# Tech Radar for Compass: Summary

This page summarizes what we've learned about the Tech Radar for Compass and its configuration options.

## Overview

The Tech Radar for Compass is a powerful visualization tool for tracking and communicating technology adoption across your organization. Based on the [AOE Technology Radar](https://www.aoe.com/techradar/), it provides a structured way to assess, categorize, and communicate your technology landscape.

## Key Components

The Tech Radar for Compass consists of several key components:

### Quadrants

Quadrants represent different technology categories. By default, the radar includes four quadrants:

1. **Languages & Frameworks** - Programming languages and frameworks
2. **Methods & Patterns** - Development methodologies, architectural patterns, and processes
3. **Platforms & Operations** - Infrastructure, platforms, and operational technologies
4. **Tools** - Development and operational tools

### Rings

Rings represent different stages of technology adoption, from innermost to outermost:

1. **Adopt** - Technologies that are proven and recommended for use
2. **Trial** - Technologies that are promising and should be explored in projects
3. **Assess** - Technologies worth exploring to understand their potential impact
4. **Hold** - Technologies that should be avoided for new projects

### Status Flags

Status flags indicate the state of items on the radar:

1. **New** - For newly added items
2. **Changed** - For items that have moved between rings
3. **Default** - For unchanged items

### Items

Items are the technologies, methodologies, or tools that you want to track on your radar. Each item has:

- A unique identifier
- A title and description
- A quadrant assignment
- A ring assignment
- Tags for filtering
- A history of releases

## Configuration Options

The Tech Radar for Compass offers extensive configuration options through the Settings page:

### Display Settings

- **Feature Toggles**: Enable or disable specific features
- **Section Order**: Rearrange the order of sections on the main page
- **Quadrant Order**: Rearrange the order of quadrants

### Content Settings

- **General**: Basic settings like the radar version
- **Quadrant Details**: Configure each quadrant's color, title, and description
- **Rings**: Configure each ring's color, title, and radius
- **Status Flags**: Configure the colors and labels for status flags
- **Labels**: Customize various text labels throughout the application
- **About Page Content**: Customize the content of the About page

### Logo Settings

- **SVG Logo**: Upload or paste SVG code for your logo
- **Logo Preview**: Preview how your logo will appear
- **Show App Name**: Toggle whether to show the application name next to the logo on subpages

### Chart Data

- **Import JSON**: Import radar data from a JSON file or pasted JSON content
- **Export JSON**: Export radar data to a JSON file

## Best Practices

Based on our exploration of the Tech Radar for Compass, here are some best practices for using it effectively:

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with the default quadrants and rings, then customize as needed
2. **Be Consistent**: Use consistent naming conventions and color schemes
3. **Provide Context**: Add detailed descriptions to help users understand your technology choices
4. **Update Regularly**: Keep your radar up to date to reflect your current technology landscape
5. **Gather Feedback**: Involve stakeholders in the radar creation and maintenance process
6. **Document Decisions**: Use the radar to document and communicate technology decisions
7. **Balance Detail**: Include enough detail to be useful, but not so much that it becomes overwhelming

## Next Steps

Now that you understand the Tech Radar for Compass and its configuration options, you can:

1. **Set Up Your Radar**: Follow the [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started/) guide to set up your radar
2. **Configure Your Radar**: Use the [Settings Page](/docs/admin-guide/settings-page-overview/) to customize your radar
3. **Add Items**: Use the [Managing Items](/docs/admin-guide/managing-items/) guide to populate your radar
4. **Share Your Radar**: Share your radar with stakeholders to communicate your technology landscape

## Conclusion

The Tech Radar for Compass is a powerful tool for visualizing and communicating your technology landscape. By following the guidelines in this documentation, you can create a radar that effectively communicates your technology choices and recommendations to stakeholders across your organization.
